```html
<section class="text">
          <h2 class="title">
            Improve your front-end skills by building projects
          </h2>
          <p class="content">
            Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding
            skills to the next level
          </p>
        </section>
```

```css
:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --light_gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --grayish_blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
